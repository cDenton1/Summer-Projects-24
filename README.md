# Summer-Projects-24
Besides working all summer, I also wanted to work on a bunch of projects and just continue learning as well. That is why I made this repository, a way for me to easily compile everything and anything I worked on in one place; small projects, big projects, useful resources, whatever. All of it will be accessible through links on this file or folders in the repository. Keeps me accountable to update, gives me something to look back on in the fall, and might even motivate me to do again next summer. <br /> <br />

## Resources
Any sort of resource I find or someone sends me that I find useful will be linked below along with descriptions <br />
**W3Schools** - useful for any sort of programming help in pretty much any language, https://www.w3schools.com/ <br />
**TryHackMe Free Rooms** - literally a GitHub repository that lists only free rooms (I used this to get back into TryHackMe), https://github.com/winterrdog/tryhackme-free-rooms <br />
**Udemy** - has a ton of courses and certificates for learning anything and everyting, https://www.udemy.com/
<br /> <br />

## Certification Progressions and Completions
Any certification I work on and complete this summer, even short Certificates of Completions, will be listed below with the start and end date as well as a link to the credential. All of these will also be added to my LinkedIn, hopefully as I'm completing them, but this is to show how long it has taken me and maybe even some notes on them: <br />

**My LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-denton/ <br /> <br />

**Deploying Your First Resources in Azure** - Started and completed May 17th <br />
Pretty much everything I had worked on over the last two weeks but instead of programming it through Terraform, <br />
everything was done through the portal online, but this showed another possible way of setting this stuff up <br />
Certificate: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d3f91935-f233-4262-a79e-f4b351cc27db/ <br /> <br />

**Exchange Server & Exchange Online** Started May 17th and completed TBD <br />
Certificate: To be added... <br /> <br />

## Programming
First thing I picked up for the summer, learning to code in Python and working on my coding skills overall and just in general. Main way I'm doing this is through **Codedex**, an online code editor that also includes lessons, challenges, projects and a community to work through it with. Listed below will be links and comments to some of my builds, projects, and account: <br />

**My Account**: https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1 <br />

**#30NitesOfCode**: [Check out my progress!](https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/30-nites-of-code) <br />

**April 28th-29th**: Began the #30NitesOfCode challenge, which is updated daily on X <br />
This is for day 1 and day 2, which I just worked on making a calculator with different modes <br />
https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/calculator <br /> <br />

**April 30th**: Worked through some lessons and released my first project, a simple roman numerals convertor <br /> 
The build - https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/roman-numerals-to-decimal-conversion <br />
The post - https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/XZSFMzlhvJEK75gbloOP <br /> <br />

**May 1st**: Began a new build, a hexadecimal, binary and decimal convertor <br />
Bit of a repeat lab from my 2nd semester but more of a challenge <br />
https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/hexadecimal,-decimal,-and-binary-conversions <br /> <br />

**May 2nd**: Finished up the build I started yesterday for day 5 of #30NitesOfCode <br />
Along with completing and posting this small project, I compiled some of the progress for TikTok <br />
The project - https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/wrhhOvosaCsEV5lzHtKW <br /> <br />

**May 3rd**: Working on and finished the build that I had started for day 1 and 2<br />
The build - https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/calculator <br /> <br />

**May 4th-5th**: Started working through HTML lessons to change it up a bit, kept these days pretty basic <br />
My little #30NitesOfCode buddy, Hux, evolved (he's the little gif closer to the top of the page) <br /> <br />

**May 6th**: Did a little bit of Python on Codedex, wanted to keep my streak going on there <br />
Spent a good chunk of time learning about Terrform and getting it setup to try and work on <br />
Terrform tutorial: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/infrastructure-as-code <br /> <br />

**May 7th-8th**: Continued with Terraform and made a vm with Terraform and Azure <br />
Did a little bit of Python on Codedex and went through some Python rooms on TryHackMe <br /> <br />

**May 9th**: Made a second vm in Terraform and Azure, connected both of them <br />
And on Codedex I did a little bit more of some Python, as well as some JS on TryHackMe <br /> <br />

**May 10th-12th**: Worked more on Terraform, more reading an understanding downsides of it etc. <br />
Completed a JavaScript room on THM, and worked on some JS, HTML, and command line stuff <br /> <br />

**May 13th**: Continued with Terrform and Azure, specifically learning modules <br /> 
And finished the command line lessons on Codedex, which was very basic stuff <br /> <br />

**May 14th-15th**: Began the SQL lessons on Codedex and started work on a rough <br />
and updated idea from something I thought of and started on back in high school <br /> <br />

**May 16th**: Started working on messing around with some code from the idea I mentioned above <br />
Originally trying it with HTML but considering switching to Python and making it an app instead <br /> <br />

**May 17th**: Continued with the SQL lessons on Codedex and finsihed an Azure certification for work <br /> <br />

## Networking
Continuing on the path of learning new things but also working on and practicing some skills I've already learned was definitly something I wanted to do. For this I'm using **TryHackMe**, an online resource for learning everything and anything networking and security related. Highly recommended by classmates and professors. Listed below will be comments on progress from that day and links to rooms I've worked through/ completed and my account: <br />
