# Summer-Projects-24
Besides working all summer, I also wanted to work on a bunch of projects and just continue learning as well. That is why I made this repository, a way for me to easily compile everything and anything I worked on in one place; small projects, big projects, useful resources, whatever. All of it will be accessible through links on this file or folders in the repository. Keeps me accountable to update, gives me something to look back on in the fall, and might even motivate me to do again next summer.

## Resources
Any sort of resource I find or someone sends me that I find useful will be linked below along with descriptions <br />
**W3Schools** - useful for any sort of programming help in pretty much any language, https://www.w3schools.com/ <br />
**TryHackMe Free Rooms** - literally a GitHub repository that lists only free rooms (I used this to get back into TryHackMe), https://github.com/winterrdog/tryhackme-free-rooms

## Codedex - Programming
First thing I picked up for the summer, learning to code in Python and working on my coding skills overall and just in general. Main way I'm doing this is through **Codedex**, an online code editor that also includes lessons, challenges, projects and a community to work through it with. Listed below will be links and comments to some of my builds, projects, and account: <br />

**My Account**: https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1 <br /> <br />

**April 28th-29th**: Began the #30NitesOfCode challenge, which is updated daily on X <br />
This is for day 1 and day 2, which I just worked on making a calculator with different modes <br />

**April 30th**: Worked through some lessons and released my first project, a simple roman numerals convertor <br /> 
The build - https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/roman-numerals-to-decimal-conversion <br />
The post - https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/XZSFMzlhvJEK75gbloOP <br /> <br />

**May 1st**: Began a new build, a hexadecimal, binary and decimal convertor <br />
Bit of a repeat lab from my 2nd semester but more of a challenge <br />

## TryHackMe - Networking
Continuing on the path of learning new things but also working on and practicing some skills I've already learned was definitly something I wanted to do. For this I'm using **TryHackMe**, an online resource for learning everything and anything networking and security related. Highly recommended by classmates and professors. Listed below will be comments on progress from that day and links to rooms I've worked through/ completed and my account: <br />

**April 29th**: Completed the first room, started the second but had taken a break to try some other ones <br />
https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfilesystemanalysis and https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxmodules <br /> <br />

**April 30th**: Went through some fundamentals and got my second badge, **cat linux.txt** <br /> 
https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart1 and https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart2 <br /> <br />

**May 1st**: Finished the fundamentals and leveled up to level 4 today <br />
