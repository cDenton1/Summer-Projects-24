# Summer-Projects-24
Besides working all summer, I also wanted to work on a bunch of projects and just continue learning as well. That is why I made this repository, a way for me to easily compile everything and anything I worked on in one place; small projects, big projects, useful resources, whatever. All of it will be accessible through links on this file or folders in the repository. Keeps me accountable to update, gives me something to look back on in the fall, and might even motivate me to do again next summer. <br /> <br />

## Progress Logs
Progress logs will be kept in the corresponding directory and outlined in those README.md files. These will be kept for programming, which can be for my job, just in general, or for Codedex and their #30NitesOfCode challenge. As well as networking, which again can be for either for my job, courses I'm taking, or TryHackMe <br />

## Resources
Any sort of resource I find or someone sends me that I find useful will be linked below along with descriptions <br />
**W3Schools** - useful for any sort of programming help in pretty much any language, https://www.w3schools.com/ <br />
**TryHackMe Free Rooms** - literally a GitHub repository that lists only free rooms (I used this to get back into TryHackMe), https://github.com/winterrdog/tryhackme-free-rooms <br />
**Udemy** - has a ton of courses and certificates for learning anything and everyting, https://www.udemy.com/
<br /> <br />

## Certification Progressions and Completions
Any certification I work on and complete this summer, even short Certificates of Completions, will be listed below with the start and end date as well as a link to the credential. All of these will also be added to my LinkedIn, hopefully as I'm completing them, but this is to show how long it has taken me and maybe even some notes on them: <br />

**Deploying Your First Resources in Azure** - Started and completed May 17th <br />
Pretty much everything I had worked on over the last two weeks but instead of programming it through Terraform, <br />
everything was done through the portal online, but this showed another possible way of setting this stuff up <br />
