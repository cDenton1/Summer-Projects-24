# Summer-Projects-24
Besides working all summer, I also wanted to work on a bunch of projects and just continue learning as well. That is why I made this repository, a way for me to easily compile everything and anything I worked on in one place; small projects, big projects, useful resources, whatever. All of it will be accessible through links on this file or folders in the repository. Keeps me accountable to update, gives me something to look back on in the fall, and might even motivate me to do again next summer.

## Codedex
First thing I picked up in this past week, learning to code in Python and just working on coding overall and in general. Main way I'm doing this is through **Codedex**, an online code editor that also includes lessons, challenges, projects and a community to work through it with. Listed below will be links and comments to some of my random builds, projects, and account: <br />

## TryHackMe
Continuing on the path of learning new things but also working on and practicing some skills I've already learned was definitly something I wanted to do. For this I'm using **TryHackMe**, an online resource for learning everything and anything networking and security related. Highly recommended by classmates and professors. Listed below will be links and comments to rooms I worked on and completed, as well as my account: <br />
