# Summer-Projects-24
Besides working all summer, I also wanted to work on a bunch of projects and just continue learning as well. That is why I made this repository, a way for me to easily compile everything and anything I worked on in one place; small projects, big projects, useful resources, whatever. All of it will be accessible through links on this file or folders in the repository. Keeps me accountable to update, gives me something to look back on in the fall, and might even motivate me to do again next summer. <br /> <br />

## Progress Logs
Progress logs will be kept in the corresponding directory and outlined in those README.md files. I will keep a couple, one for networking and programming. These can include anything from my job, just in general, courses I'm taking/working through, or something specific like Codedex and the #30NitesOfCode challenge (programming) or TryHackMe (networking): <br />

## Resources
Any sort of resource I find or someone sends me that I find useful will be linked below along with descriptions <br />
**W3Schools** - useful for any sort of programming help in pretty much any language, https://www.w3schools.com/ <br />
**TryHackMe Free Rooms** - literally a GitHub repository that lists only free rooms (I used this to get back into TryHackMe), https://github.com/winterrdog/tryhackme-free-rooms <br />
**Udemy** - has a ton of courses and certificates for learning anything and everything, https://www.udemy.com/
<br /> <br />

## Certification Progressions and Completions
Any certification I work on and complete this summer, even short Certificates of Completions, will be listed below with the start and end date as well as a link to the credential. All of these will also be added to my LinkedIn, hopefully as I'm completing them, but this is to show how long it has taken me and maybe even some notes on them: **My LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-denton/ <br /> <br />

**Deploying Your First Resources in Azure** - Started and completed May 17th <br />
Pretty much everything I had worked on over the last two weeks but instead of programming it through Terraform, <br />
everything was done through the portal online, but this showed another possible way of setting this stuff up <br />

**Exchange Server & Exchange Online** - Started May 17th and completed May 30th <br />
In depth course on ton of concepts within Microsoft Exchange On-Premise and Microsoft Exchange Online <br />
Certificate: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-8ed9aa78-a1ba-44f8-b760-ffb648eeeb44/ <br /> <br />

**Master Microsoft PowerShell** - Started and completed May 31st <br />
Short simple course of PowerShell scripting. I have had the chance to work with scripting prior to this, that was <br />
more hands-on and more of me figuring out how PowerShell worked compared to this, but this was nice to have <br /> 
an actual explanation of scripting besides me just guessing. <br />
