## Networking
Continuing on the path of learning new things but also working on and practicing some skills I've already learned was definitly something I wanted to do. For this I'm using **TryHackMe**, an online resource for learning everything and anything networking and security related. Highly recommended by classmates and professors. Listed below will be my log that includes comments on progress from that day and links to the rooms I've worked through/completed and my account: <br />
