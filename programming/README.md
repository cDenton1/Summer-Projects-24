## Programming
First thing I picked up for the summer, learning to code in Python and working on my coding skills overall and just in general. Main way I'm doing this is through **Codedex**, an online code editor that 
also includes lessons, challenges, projects and a community to work through it with. Listed below will be links and comments to some of my builds, projects, and account. This will be the log I keep for all 
of my progress in Codedex and just in general: <br />

**April 28th-29th**: Began the #30NitesOfCode challenge, which is updated daily on X <br />
This is for day 1 and day 2, which I just worked on making a calculator with different modes <br />

**April 30th**: Worked through some lessons and released my first project, a simple roman numerals convertor <br /> 
The build - https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/roman-numerals-to-decimal-conversion <br />
The post - https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/XZSFMzlhvJEK75gbloOP <br /> <br />

**May 1st**: Began a new build, a hexadecimal, binary and decimal convertor <br />
Bit of a repeat lab from my 2nd semester but more of a challenge <br />

**May 2nd**: Finished up the build I started yesterday for day 5 of #30NitesOfCode <br />
Along with completing and posting this small project, I compiled some of the progress for TikTok <br />
The project - https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/wrhhOvosaCsEV5lzHtKW <br /> <br />

**May 3rd**: Working on and finished the build that I had started for day 1 and 2<br />
The build - https://www.codedex.io/@treegoat1/calculator <br /> <br />

**May 4th-5th**: Started working through HTML lessons to change it up a bit, kept these days pretty basic <br />
My little #30NitesOfCode buddy, Hux, evolved (he's the little gif closer to the top of the page) <br /> <br />

**May 6th**: Did a little bit of Python on Codedex, wanted to keep my streak going on there <br />
Spent a good chunk of time learning about Terrform and getting it setup to try and work on <br />
Terrform tutorial: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/infrastructure-as-code <br /> <br />

**May 7th-8th**: Continued with Terraform and made a vm with Terraform and Azure <br />
Did a little bit of Python on Codedex and went through some Python rooms on TryHackMe <br /> <br />

**May 9th**: Made a second vm in Terraform and Azure, connected both of them <br />
And on Codedex I did a little bit more of some Python, as well as some JS on TryHackMe <br /> <br />

**May 10th-12th**: Worked more on Terraform, more reading an understanding downsides of it etc. <br />
Completed a JavaScript room on THM, and worked on some JS, HTML, and command line stuff <br /> <br />

**May 13th**: Continued with Terrform and Azure, specifically learning modules <br /> 
And finished the command line lessons on Codedex, which was very basic stuff <br /> <br />

**May 14th-15th**: Began the SQL lessons on Codedex and started work on a rough <br />
and updated idea from something I thought of and started on back in high school <br /> <br />

**May 16th**: Started working on messing around with some code from the idea I mentioned above <br />
Originally trying it with HTML but considering switching to Python and making it an app instead <br /> <br />

**May 17th**: Continued with the SQL lessons on Codedex and finsihed an Azure certification for work <br /> 
https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d3f91935-f233-4262-a79e-f4b351cc27db/ <br /> <br />

**May 18th-19th**: Finished all of the SQL lessons on Codedex, Queries and Aggregates <br /> <br />

**May 20th-26th**: Working through the HTML lessons on Codedex <br /> 
Learning PowerShell scripting and automation for work, see the subdirectory **PowerShell_Scripts** <br /> 
https://github.com/cDenton1/Summer-Projects-24/tree/main/programming/PowerShell_Scripts <br /> <br />

**May 27th**: Completed the **#30NitesOfCode** challenge on Codedex! https://x.com/ClickCreated/status/1795249692412096831 <br />
Just did a timed-test in Terraform today to keep it lighter on the programming and also a fun way to end off this challenge <br /> <br />

**May 28th-June 5th**: finished all the free HTML lessons on Codedex, finished a PowerShell scripting course <br />
for work, finished a Terraform course for work and have been working on my personal project with embedding the <br />
map into the website and figuring out how to get that working how I'd like (will be changing it) <br /> <br />

**June 6th-10th**: continued with my personal project [Campus_Directory](https://github.com/cDenton1/Summer-Projects-24/tree/main/programming/Campus_Directory) and added the code to GitHub <br />
Also began working on the CSS lessons on Codedex since I if I go with webpage there is a lot of visual elements <br /> <br />
